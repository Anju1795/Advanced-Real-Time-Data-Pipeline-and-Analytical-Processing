# Scalability Considerations

-For scaling this pipeline to handle millions of files per day, we need to focus on handling high-volume data ingestion, processing, and storage while ensuring the system can scale horizontally.

1. Data Ingestion
    -Using a distributed system like Apache Kafka or Google cloud(Pub/sub) functions(serverless)for event streaming:
    Kafka can handle a high volume of real-time data streams. Each file upload or data change can
    trigger an event that is sent to a Kafka topic to continuously capture and analyze sensor data from IoT devices. Kafka producers (applications that generate CSV files) send events to Kafka topics. Kafka consumers (data processing jobs) can pull messages(subscribe) from these topics in parallel.Kafka can horizontally scale by adding more brokers to handle increasing loads.

    -In Google cloud pub/sub, Once we subscribe to a pub/sub topic, we can trigger processing when new files are uploaded to cloud storage. This can scale horizontally without the need to manage infrastructure. Every time a new file is uploaded to the storage service, a function can be triggered to process the data. Once the message is published, the cloud function will be triggered to process the data.

2. Data processing

    -Once data is ingested, we need to process it, perform transformations, and apply cleaning rules.
        -Batch Processing:
        Use Apache Spark for batch processing large datasets from cloud storage.
        -Stream Processing:
        Implement Spark Streaming or Kafka Streams for real-time data processing.
        Stream processors can continuously clean, transform, and aggregate data as files arrive in the pipeline.
        -Data Parallelism: Data is split across nodes in the cluster, and each node processes its partition of data concurrently, significantly speeding up the processing time.

    -For data cleaning and transformation, we can use pySpark(for cleaning, transformation and aggregation). We can use custom retry mechanisms for fault tolerance.

3. Data storage
    -PostgreSQl can be used for normalized storage(partitioning and indexing can be done) or data warehouses like AWS Redshift or Google bigquery 

4. For visualizing and querying data, Power BI, Tableau can be used by connecting to PostgreSQL.

5. Horizontal scalability and optimization
    -We can use Google Cloud's Compute Engine Autoscaler to dynamically scale processing resources as data volume increases.

    -For optimization of high volume, tables can be partioned in postgreSQL, create indexes on frequently queried fields like noted_date, out/in etc., use in-memory caching systems for frequently accessed data.

6. Monitor the working flow of the pipeline using Prometheus/Grafana and handle any errors using Pub/sub messages.
